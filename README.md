## Features

- Customizable attack parameters (requests per second, attack duration)
- Bypasses SSL certificate verification for HTTPS targets
- Easy-to-use interface

## Installation

Follow the steps below to install and run NetHammer:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. You'll also need to install a few Python libraries:

- `requests`

You can install these dependencies using `pip`.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```

### Step 2: Install Required Python Packages

If the `requirements.txt` file is not included, you can manually install the required packages:

### Step 3: Run the Script

Youâ€™re now ready to run NetHammer. Execute the script with:

```bash

### Usage

When you run the script, you'll be prompted to enter the target website, the number of requests per second, and the duration of the attack. Here's an example:

```bash
Enter the target website: https://example.com
Enter the number of requests to send per second: 100
Enter the duration of the attack in seconds: 60
```
